# üó≥Ô∏è Online Voting System with Blockchain & Iris Authentication

## üöÄ Project Description
A **secure online voting system** using:
- **Blockchain** for securing votes
- **Iris Authentication** for voter verification
- **MySQL for user and vote data**
- **Modern PyQt5 UI**

## System Architecture
**The process begins with the voter login, followed by iris data matching for identity verification. If the iris data is not valid, the system stops further access. However, if the data is valid, the user proceeds to the voting stage, where they can choose their preferred candidate. Once the candidate is selected, the system checks whether the vote has been successfully cast. If not, the system prompts the user to perform the voting again. Once the vote is successfully submitted, it is updated in the results database. Finally, the process concludes with the voter logging out of the system. This secure and systematic flow ensures both identity verification through biometrics and accurate vote recording.**
